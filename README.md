## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned to add a gradient to the background. It was also fun to learn to position icons for the cards. It was really challenging to position the hero image. It is still not perfect. Maybe I tackle it later again.
